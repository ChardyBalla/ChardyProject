<h2>Description</h2>
Yellevate has been dealing with client disagreements for several years. Yellevate describes conflicts as customers who are dissatisfied with the company's services and refuse to pay for them. This has been a financial strain, and statistically, roughly 20% of the claims filed against Yellevate ended in a payment opt-out, resulting in a 5% yearly income loss (in USD).
